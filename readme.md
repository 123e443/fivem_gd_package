This is a collection of things I've made for FiveM. Mainly most of this was made for the use on [Transport Tycoon](http://tycoon.community) before I took over ownership of it.
All of these resources are old development versions, they may not work at all, and some of them were never in a state where they had any use.

This is made public due to the fact that some "smart" individual is trying to sell it somewhere on the deep webz, and why not fuck them over by leaking it myself instead. 

Enjoy broken stuff, maybe you can dig out some stuff from it.

Some of these things may also be modified versions of existing things, there may or may not be credits, I can't really tell at this point.
